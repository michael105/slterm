Patches and additions are welcome,
preferrably as patches.
(Please look up my email at github.com/michael105)

Especially documentation is needed.


The codebase still isn't clean,
in turn there are no special requirements.

Preferred code style is close to linux kernel.

If possible, try to keep all changes together in
logical blocks, and use macros to keep
additions optional. 

ifdefs, or something like 
#define IFDEF_THEADDITION(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define IFNDEF_THEADDITION(...) __VA_ARGS__

void func( int x, int y IFDEF_ADDITION( , int z ) ){ 
...


By submitting any patches or additions you agree to
publish the code within the terms of the MIT license.



Please don't write any code which is dependent on the scrollback buffer,
since I'm going to rewrite the whole thing.



Ideas for modifications:

Reenable utf8 mode.

A configuration file.

Sessions, storing current shell, path, and running programs.

Integration with tabbed, or any other tiling manager via XEmbed.

Sort of a textual configuration menu.
(Having another term window, which has an embedded menu
 to display and modify settings)

embedded shell
embedded telnet client

get rid of freetype, using embedded fonts instead.
