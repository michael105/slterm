.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBslterm\fP is a virtual terminal emulator for X
.sp
It is a slimmed down descendant of st (suckless.org)
with several additions and patches.
.sp
utf\-8 and rgb support are stripped for better performance and less memory usage.
.SH USAGE
.sp
The most important key combination might be
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCtrl+F1\fP
Show a help screen with all shortcuts.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The usage of slterm differs from other terminal emulators by its three different main modes.
.SS normalmode
.sp
The codepage can be changed via hotkeys. (\fICtrl+Shift+0..9\fP).
.sp
Paste from the clipbard with \fIShift+Insert\fP\&.
.sp
Set Bookmarks to the current line with \fICtrl+Shift+0..9\fP
Scroll back to a bookmark with \fICtrl+0..9\fP
.SS lessmode
.sp
In lessmode it is possible to browse the scrollback buffer via
the standard less like keybindings.
.sp
\fICtrl+Shift Up/Down/PgUp/PdDown\fP enter lessmode
\fIShift+Backspace\fP enters lessmode and browses back to the last line,
a command has been entered.
.sp
in lessmode, it is possible to browse between the marks of commands,
comfirmed with \fIEnter\fP in the shell via \fIBackspace\fP or \fITab left\fP and \fITab\fP\&.
.sp
\fIShift+Enter\fP in Normal mode enters lessmode, if the output
of a command is more than a screen.
.SS selectionmode
.sp
In selection mode it is possible to select lines or areas (either by lines,
or rectangular areas).
enter with \fIAlt+S\fP, start selecting with \fIv\fP or \fIs\fP and the cursor keys,
switch between rectangular selection and line selection with \fIt\fP,
copy to the clipboard with \fIEnter\fP\&.
\fIy\fP selects the current line, hit \fIy\fP with a active selection yanks the
selection to the clipboard and exits selection mode,
\fIyy\fP (sort of vim binding) selects the current line
and yanks it to the clipboard.
.SH TERMINAL
.sp
slterm is mostly VT100 compatible, please look in question for the according manuals.
Here only some of the vt100 or slterm additions are described.
.sp
slterm starts either the env variable SHELL, /bin/sh, or a command supplied with
\fIslterm \-e command\fP\&.
.sp
Several Variables are exported into the environment.
.SS Colors
.sp
The basic 8 colors, accesible in the shell as:
$BLACK, $RED, $GREEN, $YELLOW, $BLUE, $MAGENTA, $CYAN, $WHITE.
.sp
The can be combined with prefixes: L(ight), D(ark), LD(light\-dark), BD(background).
L: $LGREEN, D: $DRED, $LD: $LDCYAN, BG: $BGBLUE.
.sp
These Colors cannot be combined: ORANGE, ORANGERED, BROWN, BGBROWN, PURPLE, GRAY, MINT, TURQUOISE
.sp
Other text attributes are: $BOLD, $FAINT, $CURSIVE, $UNDERLINE, $BLINK, $REVERSE, $STRIKETHROUGH, $DOUBLEUNDERLINE.
.sp
The text attributes can be combined, with some special combinations:
BLINK and REVERSE blinks by reversing colors.
STRIKETHROUGH and UNDERLINE get a double underline.
.sp
The default foreground and background color and attributes can be reset with $NORMAL.
.sp
255 Colors can be set with:
foreground: "e[38;5;XXm", XX one of 0 \- 255.
background: "e[48;5;XXm", XX one of 0 \- 255.
.SS Cursor
.sp
There are several cursor shapes, set with: "e[X q".
X one of 0..12:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
1,2: block cursor
.IP \(bu 2
3,4: underline
.IP \(bu 2
5,6: vertical bar
.UNINDENT
.SS slterm additions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
7:   \(aqX\(aq
.IP \(bu 2
7;Y: Y is the ascii code of the char, used as cursor
.IP \(bu 2
8:   double underline
.IP \(bu 2
9:   empty block
.IP \(bu 2
10:  underline, two lines at the sides
.IP \(bu 2
11:  underline and overline, lines right and left
.IP \(bu 2
12:  overline, lines right and left
.UNINDENT
.SS Bell
.sp
Sending a bell to the terminal (echo \-e "007") sends
the according notification (XBell) to the window manager.
.SH INSTALL
.sp
If obtained from source, edit the files config.make and config.h
to customize slterm. Type \fImake\fP, and \fImake install\fP\&.
.sp
If you downloaded the statically linked binary,
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
copy the binary to a suitable place (/usr/local/bin)
.IP \(bu 2
install the terminal info file: (for curses) \fIslterm \-I | tic \-sx \-\fP
.IP \(bu 2
If needed, download this man page in its man format(slterm.1)
from github (github.com/michael105/slterm),
copy into the appropiate directory (/usr/local/share/man/man1)
.UNINDENT
.SS CURSES
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
To be used with curses, the installation of the terminfo database file is needed.
slterm.terminfo is supplied in the sources, within the folder src.
It can be installed with \fItic \-sx slterm.terminfo\fP\&.
Alternatively, the termcap database "linux" seems to be mostly compatible.
Set with \fIexport TERM=linux\fP
.sp
The terminfo database of slterm is also displayed, when slterm was compiled with
EMBEDRESOURCES. Type \fIslterm \-I\fP, to install: \fIslterm \-I | tic \-sx \-\fP\&.
The key combination \fICtrl+Shift+Win+ALT+I\fP will dump the terminal info to
the terminal as well, and can be used, to install the terminal info within
a remote shell. ( type \fItic \-sx \-\fP, hit \fICtrl+Shift+Win+Alt+I\fP, and \fICtrl+D\fP )
.sp
Tic is the terminfo compiler, available from the curses distributions.
There is a statically linked binary for linux, 64bit of tic at
github.com/michael105/static\-bin
(125kB, sha3sum: 510f25bdb35c437c0bc28690a6d292f128113144fee93cf37b01381c)
Sources of tic and netbsd curses: github.com/oasislinux/netbsd\-curses/

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP
disable alternate screens in terminal
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP \fIclass\fP
defines the window class (default $TERM).
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP \fIfont\fP
defines the \fIfont\fP to use when slterm is run.
.TP
.B \fB\-g\fP \fIgeometry\fP
defines the X11 geometry string. The form is
[=][<cols>{xX}<rows>][{+\-}<xoffset>{+\-}<yoffset>]. See
\fBXParseGeometry\fP (3) for further details.
.TP
.B \fB\-i\fP
will fixate the position given with the \-g option.
.TP
.B \fB\-n\fP \fIname\fP
defines the window instance name (default $TERM).
.TP
.B \fB\-o\fP \fIiofile\fP
writes all the I/O to \fIiofile.\fP This feature is useful when recording
slterm sessions. A value of "\-" means standard output.
.TP
.B \fB\-T\fP \fItitle\fP
defines the window title (default \(aqslterm\(aq).
.TP
.B \fB\-t\fP \fItitle\fP
defines the window title (default \(aqslterm\(aq).
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP \fIwindowid\fP
embeds slterm within the window identified by \fIwindowid\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-l\fP \fIline\fP
use a tty \fIline\fP instead of a pseudo terminal. \fIline\fP should be a
(pseudo\-)serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 on Linux for serial port 0).
When this flag is given remaining arguments are used as flags for
\fBstty(1).\fP By default slterm initializes the serial line to 8 bits, no
parity, 1 stop bit and a 38400 baud rate. The speed is set by
appending it as last argument (e.g. \(aqslterm \-l /dev/ttyS0 115200\(aq).
Arguments before the last one are \fBstty(1)\fP flags. If you want to
set odd parity on 115200 baud use for example \(aqslterm \-l /dev/ttyS0
parenb parodd 115200\(aq. Set the number of bits by using for example
\(aqslterm \-l /dev/ttyS0 cs7 115200\(aq. See \fBstty(1)\fP for more arguments and
cases.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP
prints version information, then exits.
.TP
.B \fB\-V\fP
prints version and compile information, then exits
.TP
.B \fB\-e\fP \fIcommand\fP \fB[\fP \fIarguments\fP \fB\&... ]\fP
slterm executes \fIcommand\fP instead of the shell. If this is used it \fBmust
be the last option\fP on the command line, as in xterm / rxvt. This
option is only intended for compatibility, and all the remaining
arguments are used as a command even without it.
.TP
.B \fB\-x\fP
enable reading of the XResources database for the configuration
slterm must have been compiled with the XRESOURCES flag in config.h.in set to 1
.TP
.B \fB\-X\fP
lock all memory pages into memory, prevent swapping.
Secrets could be revealed, also years later, if the memory
is swapped to disk. Worse, with flash disks also erasing
the contents will not necessarily erase the written cells.
This option locks all memory pages into ram.
