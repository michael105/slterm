The fonts LiberationMono_Bold and LiberationMono_BoldItalic,
to be optionally embedded into the binary.

It's better to install those fonts, if not already present.

Anyways, to have a working font with the statically linked binary,
they can be embedded. (+600kB)


To include other fonts (schematically): 

xxd -i font.ttf > font.c
gcc -c font.c
