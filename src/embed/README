The fonts LiberationMono_Bold and LiberationMono_BoldItalic,
to be optionally embedded into the binary.

I suggest to install those fonts, if not already present.

Anyways, to have a working font with the statically linked binary,
they can be embedded. (+400kB)


The fonts bold and bold italic are empty files, since the regular font is already bold.
For the attribute bold the color is changed to bright.
(this behaviour can be changed in config.h)

The empty files are needed anyways.


The font files are compressed with tools/ttfz
Decompress them with tools/ttfdz


To change the embedded fonts, copy the ttf font files into this directory, 
overwriting the existing ttf files,
update the size of the uncompressed ttf files in embed_fonts.h,
(manually or execute updatesizes.sh)
and rerun make. (set EMBEDFONT := 1 in config.make, or `make static`)
