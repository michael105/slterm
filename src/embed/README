The fonts LiberationMono_Bold and LiberationMono_BoldItalic,
to be optionally embedded into the binary.

It's better to install those fonts, if not already present.

Anyways, to have a working font with the statically linked binary,
they can be embedded. (+600kB)


The fonts bold and bold italic are empty files, since the regular font is already bold.
For the attribute bold the color is changed to bright.
The empty files are needed anyways.
