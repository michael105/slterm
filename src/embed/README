The fonts LiberationMono_Bold and LiberationMono_BoldItalic,
to be optionally embedded into the binary.

The files are renamed to slterm_font.ttf and slterm_font_italic.ttf, 
regardless of their weight, I prefer bold fonts at the terminal.
"Bold" is shown as bright color instead.

This can be changed in config.h


I suggest to install those Liberation fonts when installing slterm,
if not already present.


Anyways, to have a working font especially with the statically linked binary,
they can be embedded. (+400kB)


The empty ttf files are needed anyways for the build process.


To change the embedded fonts, copy the ttf font files into this directory, 
overwriting the existing ttf files,
update the size of the uncompressed ttf files in embed_fonts.h,
(manually or execute updatesizes.sh)
and rerun make. (set EMBEDFONT := 1 in config.make, or `make static_embedfont`)
