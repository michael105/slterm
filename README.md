### st-asc

Fork of the st terminal. (suckless.org)

Stripped of unicode support.


Unicode encoding needs 4 Bytes per char within st,
and I nearly never need unicode chars in the terminal.

>(I'd even propose, unicode isn't needed for system administration/
development at all. You are going to get into all sort of troubles,
when, e.g., you'd name files and directories in the root fs
using unicode characters. Furthermore, let's assume, there are, say,
100.000 instances of st running. Now, on the world. Multiply this
with, umm, 10 MB, multiply with cpu cycles of 100.000 (swapping, and so on),
and . It's not theorethical anymore. Ok. The calculation might be a little bit wrong,
Admittedly, you shouldn't multiply memory and cpu cycles.
Anyways, my point is valid. And there is the computing time to add,
generated by typos. Adding a unicode character in the wrong script could create.. uuh
never mind. But that's the reason to stick to the KISS principles. Murphy's law
will strike, anyways. That's the law..)


So, in my quest to slim down all programs I'm using,
I'm about to strip unicode and utf8 support.

Yet I managed to get a memory footprint of around 8MB. 
(>20MB before)
I'm always keeping more than 10 terminals open,
so that sums up.

The smaller memory footprint also pays out in a more responsive
system overall, improving st's speed as well. (3x here, and close to urxvt now)

It's however a crude hack, much (unused) utf8 supporting code is left yet.
Hopefully the compiler does it's job eliminating unneeded potions.

Me, I'm going to strip of the rgb color support. 
Which, again, count's with 2 integers ( 8 Bytes ) per char.

256 colors might be enough for everyone.
(Am I confusing something..?..)

About utf8 (Know your enemy.. although I have nothing against utf8,
it's just useless for my main work at the terminal.)

#### roadmap

- strip unicode (done partially)
- strip rgb colors
- add patches
- gain earth domination
- quench vogones

st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
